It includes features for user registration and login, project creation and editing, skill management, education management, media file management, and static file management.

## Features

### User Registration and Login

Users can easily register and log in to the system using their credentials. The registration process ensures that each user has a unique account, while the login process verifies the user's identity before granting access to the system.

### Project Creation and Editing
